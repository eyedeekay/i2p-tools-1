You have found an I2P Reseed
============================

Maybe it was by accident, or maybe you visited the URL because you saw it in the software somewhere. While we've got
your attention, we're going to take this opportunity to tell you a little about what we do here. I2P is a peer-to-peer
network which uses "Garlic Routing" to maintain privacy. Reseed nodes help you get connected to I2P for the first time,
and even though you should only have to use them once in a great while, they are very important services.
